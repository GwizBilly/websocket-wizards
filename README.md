# websocket-wizardry
Boilerplate code for gettings started with esp8266 websocket client and nodejs websocket server.

# wss.js
This server simply responds to every client message with a simple message + incrementing number for each message received.

# esp8266WebsocketClient.ino

This is an arduino sketch that establishes a connection to the server and sends a message every few seconds containing only the number "61".
